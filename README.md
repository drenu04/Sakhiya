Sakhiya: Empowering Safety with Silent Strength
In a world where personal safety is uncertain, Sakhiya emerges as a reliable, intelligent, and user-centric solution designed to empower women and children to seek help instantly — without attracting attention or relying on complex technology.

Our working prototype blends technology, empathy, and design to deliver an impactful safety companion.

Key Features:

Real-time GPS Tracking

SMS and Call Alerts to Emergency Contacts

Telegram Bot with a 10-Second Cancel Window

Offline Functionality for low-connectivity environments

Discreet SOS Activation via button or force sensor

Though some modules like heartbeat monitoring are under development, the core system operates reliably in real-world testing.

Sakhiya is not just a wearable — it's a silent guardian, a first responder, and a digital promise of safety.
